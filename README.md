fBay
=================

# Hosted on fbay.glitch.me as github pages doesn't work great

The aim of fBay is to bring people from different backgrounds into one big community.

Here, you can talk and accumulate unnecessary items. 

We take pride in goods that have absolutely no use.

You can waste your money that could go to a good cause.
      
Our specialized users can put items they no longer want up for sale.

Everyone else can bid on that item, until the sales close. 

Bidding here initiates deep conversation, and can spark relationships that last for a lifetime.

We hope you enjoy our site, and feel free to contact our staff at jultep830@gmail.com.
